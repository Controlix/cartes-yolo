## YOLO Model Preferences

- When the user refers to "YOLO v11", it is the latest stable version of YOLO available from `ultralytics`. My previous assumption that YOLOv10 was the latest version was incorrect.
- The names of the different models are listed at https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolo11/#supported-tasks-and-modes

## Blog Post Documentation

- When creating or updating blog posts, ensure all steps are thoroughly documented and consistent with the project's state.
- The blog post is located at `/home/marc/workspace/cartes-yolo-blog/yolo-playing-cards-tutorial.html`.

## Annotation Tool

- The user will use Label Studio to create the training data.
